# Reflection
C++ Reflection library

Reflection is a way to access the typesystem at runtime, enabling a more dynamic software design.
C# and java  has built in reflection. This can be used for:

Automatic scripting support for all classes
Autogenerated GUI
Automatic model persistence (for example throught XML)

C++ does not have built-in reflection support, so it needs to be added as a library.
